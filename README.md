My dot files
============

Various configuration files, vim plugins, and misc scripts.

I usually keep all these files in ~/bin, which is on my path. Some files (bashrc, vimrc, vim/, etc)
should be symlinked to your home folder (with a '.' prepended, of course).

After checking out you should run 'git submodule update' to pull in all the git plugins.
